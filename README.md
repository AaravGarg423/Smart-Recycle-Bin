# ♻️ Smart Recycling Bin with Machine Learning and Arduino

## Overview
This project is a **smart recycling bin** that only opens when it detects a recyclable item.  
It combines **machine learning**, **Arduino-controlled motors**, and **Python code** to utilize **mechanics, electronics, and programming**.

---

## Features
- Detects recyclable items using a machine learning model 
- Opens a **cardboard lid via Arduino-controlled motors** when the item is recognized  
- Prevents **non-recyclables** from entering the bin  
- **demonstration video available on YouTube**

---

## ⚙️ Hardware
- Arduino UNO
- DC Motors to open the lid  
- Cardboard box (as the bin)  
- USB Cable  

---

## 💻 Software
- **Python scripts**   
- **Arduino code** for motor control  
- **Picture Database** 

---

## 🧠 Installation / Usage
1. Connect **Arduino** to your computer via USB.  
2. Upload the **Arduino code** to the board.  
3. Run the **Python script** to start the detection system.  
4. Place recyclable items in front of the sensor/camera and the lid will **open automatically** when detected.

## 📝 Notes
- Developed as a **personal robotics and machine learning project**  
- Trained only on a limited database, can be expanded easily though.
